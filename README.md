<strong>Lab Description:  </strong>The ability of a reverse engineer to identify the use of structures and calling conventions will greatly enhance their ability to analyze a program from disassembly. This lab will require the student to identify the use of structures, create custom structures in IDA Pro and identify calling conventions.

<strong>Lab Environment: </strong>IDA Pro Educational

<strong>Lab Files that are Needed: </strong>labFile.exe




<strong>Lab â€“ Complete the following tasks</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Identify the use of the structure, what is the size of the structure?</li>

 <li>Create a structure in IDA that represents the identified structure. Ensure that each member of your structure aligns with how it is used in the program.</li>

 <li>Rename the members to something appropriate based off of your analysis.</li>

 <li>In IDA View-A, add the structure offsets for each variable used.</li>

</ol>

There is a single regular function called in main, what calling convention does it use? What does it expect as an argument?
